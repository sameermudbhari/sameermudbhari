- 👋 Hi, I’m @sameermudbhari
- 👀 I’m interested in using multiomics approaches to understand biology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tools and techniques in genomics, proteomics and metabolomics to understand plant and microorganisms.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of biological phenomenon which could drive our understanding from what we know today.
